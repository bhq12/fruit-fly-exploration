Able to identify patterns in image no matter where in the image they occur

Share the same parameters across every subset of the image

Reduces the image resolution by performing regression across a number of smaller blocks (each with the same parameters) rather than the entire image.

Filter: What the shared parameters are known as

Strides: If we move one-by-one pixelwise when scanning across the image, even if we are considering the image in blocks we are still maintaining one "unit" (model instance)
