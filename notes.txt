- Section 1: Data Analysis / any cleansing + normalisation


Data paper:

- Organisms generally smaller towards the equator for endotherms
- For ectothersm, similar variations reported but no concrete

- In Drosophila, latitudinal variation has been found in traits such as:

	- wing length
	- wing area
	- thorax length
	- Reproductive traits, eg ovariole number



Idea:

- Use:
	- L2: second longitudinal vein length
	- L3p: proximal length of third longitudinal vein
	- L3d: distal length of third longitudinal vein
	- L3: Third longitudinal vein length
	- W1: wing width 1
	- W2: wing width 2
	- W3: Wing width 3
	- Thorax length

To predict complex fly classes. i.e. (Species, population, sex)


NEXT TODO: Implement softmax, then neural networks


To explore: ReLu vs. Logistic activation function
